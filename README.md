## What I work on app

I helped create the Footify app by turning Figma designs into working code. I paid close attention to every detail, making sure the app looked exactly like the designs. I also made sure the app worked well on different devices.

Using the right tools, I made sure the app was easy to use and looked good on any screen. I tested the app a lot to fix any problems and make it run smoothly. I worked closely with other team members to make sure everything fit together nicely. The app got positive feedback, showing that my work made a real difference in making it great
